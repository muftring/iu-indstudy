# Objective
The aim is to study and visualize the stability of nodes in temporal networks, specifically in terms of clusters and communities.

# Background
Networks are everywhere around us. They model and represent many things concrete and conceptual -- living organisms, vast ecosystems, transportation, human relationships, collaboration -- and most networks change over time.

Within networks, groups of nodes and links form around commonalities. These groups are often called clusters or communities. Comparing clustering similarity measures across temporal snapshots of networks we can measure node stability, in terms of the clusters and communities.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to identify and show the structural change in temporal networks such that we may gain  insight into how, when, and why clustering and community formation, expansion, contraction, and dissolution in temporal networks is happening.

# Activities
Further knowledge and understanding will be gained through research in relevant literature in the areas of: graph and network theory, dynamic networks, clustering and community detection, and associated metrics and measures.

Applying this analytical process on different networks, the aim is to gain specific insights into topical trends and changes.

Examples:

(1) With the American National Election Studies (ANES) data, we can study the trend of American political ideology, and shifts in general population beliefs between 1948 and 2016.

(2) Examining changes in the citation network for climate change research over a specific time span may show when breakthroughs were discovered, or when a concept or belief was disproved or superseded.

# Outcome
The outcome will be a software package which will visualize the clustering evolution temporal network dataset. It will show the evolution of the network as a whole (addition and subtraction of nodes and links), and show the evolution of communities in the network (forming, expanding, contracting, dissolving).
