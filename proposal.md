# Independent Study
Describe the project being completed (include: background, purpose, activities, and outcome). You may write the description below or attach an additional sheet.

## Proposal
### background
networks are everywhere
they model / represent a lot of things
most are dynamic: they change over time
- living organisms
- ecosystems
- transportation
- Social Networks
- collaboration

spreading happens
some of the diffusion is invasive
- information, research
- news, gossip
- disease

there is a concept of "stable node"
- what is a stable node?
- what defines a stable node?

clustering => communities
- how do they form?
- how do they collapse?

how can either of these be predicted?
- stable nodes
- communities
- diffusion

### purpose
Measuring the effects of invasive spreading on temporal networks ability to effectively cluster around stable nodes.

For the purpose of?
- predicting the formation, expansion, contraction, and dissolution of communities

### activities
research: read relevant literature in:
- graphs and networks
- temporal (dynamic) networks
- spreading phenomena
- clustering

### outcome
software which visualizes clustering evolution in temporal networks, in the presence of invasive spreading
- showing the evolution of the network as a whole
- showing the evolution of communities (forming, expanding, contracting, dissolving)
- visual component which shows the predictive measure of community evolution

# Working Thoughts

Measuring the effects of invasive spreading on temporal networks ability to effectively cluster around stable nodes.

Working statements, thoughts, questions, ToDo items:
- define "stable node"
- determine characteristics of stable nodes (are there existing measures? do we need to discover new measures?)
- how does a stable node become destabilized? how does a new node "replace" a deteriorated or eliminated stable node?
- determine an effective and possibly predictive cluster comparison metric under these circumstances (consider what is presented in YY's paper)
- determine how best to visualize the networks, in particular to show the differences between temporal slices, and emphasize where the invasive spreading is originating, and why it is having the magnitude of effect
